    "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the number of tickets available per performance for the presale. I need to look through the provided HTML content to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the HTML for any mentions of presale (\uc120\uc608\ub9e4) and the number of tickets allowed per person. The user wants the answer in numbers, so I need to find the exact figure mentioned.\n\nLooking at the text, there's a section under \"\uacf5\uc5f0\uc815\ubcf4 \ub0b4\uc6a9\" (performance information). I see a part that says \"\uc120\uc608\ub9e4 \ud68c\ub2f9 2\ub9e4.\" That translates to \"2 tickets per performance for presale.\" \n\nI should confirm if there are any other mentions that might conflict or add more details. The rest of the content talks about general sales, agencies, and contact info, but nothing conflicting. So the key point here is 2 tickets per person per performance during presale.\n\nI should make sure there's no other number mentioned elsewhere. Scanning again, there's a part about general sales allowing 4 tickets, but the user specifically asked about presale. So the correct number is 2.\n</think>\n\n\uc120\uc608\ub9e4 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud68c\ub2f9 \uad6c\ub9e4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2f0\ucf13 \uc218\ub294 **2\ub9e4**\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n(\uacf5\uc5f0\uc815\ubcf4 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \ub0b4 \"\uc120\uc608\ub9e4 \ud68c\ub2f9 2\ub9e4\" \ubb38\uad6c \ucc38\uace0)"
